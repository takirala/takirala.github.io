**FeedMe**
: A Smart Food Cluster developed using IoT and Intel Edison

- Developed a new IoT based food delivery medium using an Android application with Google App Engine as backend.
- Used Weave to communicate to a Brillo board (Intel Edison) via App Engine to control the smart cluster.


**LiveEye**
: Large Scale Object Recognition Using Deep Learning

- Built and trained a neural network to recognize 80+ object classes using 328,000 images with Caffe & py-faster-rcnn.


**Secure Facebook**

- Designed a distributed system using spray-can framework and akka actor model that simulates Facebook server.
- Re-engineered API interfaces to be more secure using public key encryption, digital signature and AES encryption.


**Chord DHT**

- This Distributed Hash Table is implemented using akka actors.
- Along with computation of finger table entries and dynamic departures were simulated.
- Dynamic building of finger tables for 100000 node departures/joins with an overall activity of 4000+ queries/sec.


**P2P Model Java Ecosystem**

- Implemented P2P model dynamic server client system in java.
- A client requests/sends information from/to bootstrap server to download the content or to distribute its chunks.


**Information Propogation** 

- An akka-actor based network implementation that micmics a distributed sensor topology.
- Gossip protocol is used for information propagation. This is used for rumor propogation (E.g.: Start of a wild fire) in real life.
- Push-Sum protocol is used for aggregation analysis in a sensor network. This efficient solution was able to simulate one lakh nodes on a single quad core machine.
- Calculated convergence rates in sparse topologies like line and 2D grid and dense topologies like star and 3D grid.


**Bit Coin Mining**

- A distributed multi-core implementation of mining for bitcoins using SHA-256 hash of randomly generated strings.
