Christmas is such a great time with the bells and lights. Happy people all around. The timing is apt as well, at the end of the year every one gets a chance to look back on the successes and failures and be thankful that all are together.

New year resolutions are always a fab. Hope you get to keep up your resolution! Instead of being overwhelmed by new resolutions, we should see it as one step at a time, one day at a time and achieve it. Happy Christmas!
