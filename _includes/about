	    <p>Last Summer, I held an Internship in Sabre at Dallas. I have worked on developing a white label solution as our Intern case study. Although I never worked on Front-End technologies before, I accepted the challenge to build a Frontend using React JS. I learnt everything from scratch and two months down the line, we had a working prototype of a bidding platform and an auto optimizer that we presented to the executives ( <a target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Vwh_Ad4NuJ8">Watch!</a> ) and my team stood in the second position out of the 18 teams participated.</p>

	    <p>During my internship at IMImobile, I worked on web service orchestration in which I used open source tools like OSWorkflow and BPEL for which I had to put a lot of research efforts. After presenting my project as Proof of Concept, I was appreciated for my contributions and was offered a position in R&D Department.
