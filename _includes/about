	I am currently pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science from University of Florida. I have developed a comprehensive skill set in various technologies over my two years of professional experience, three internships, Undergraduate degree from BITS Pilani and current graduate academic experience. <br/> I wait for the long road to be explored and I know I will cherish the rest of the path if it has a <i>console</i> that I can type in to.
